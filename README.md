## 🖥️ What is EnableUAC?  
**EnableUAC** is a lightweight script that restores and enables **User Account Control (UAC)** on Windows.  
It is especially useful if UAC has been **disabled, corrupted, or misconfigured**.  

---

## ⚙️ How it works  
- 🔑 The script **must be run as Administrator**.  
- ⚡ Once executed, it automatically re-enables UAC and sets it back to its **default configuration**.  
- 🔒 By default, UAC is restored to **Option 4 (Always notify)** — the **highest security level**, which asks for confirmation whenever apps try to make changes to your PC.  
- 🔄 After enabling UAC, the script will ask if you want to **restart your computer**:  
  - Press **`Y`** → Restart immediately  
  - Press **`N`** → Exit without restarting
